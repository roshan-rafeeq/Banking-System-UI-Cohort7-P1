# 🧑‍💻 Contribution Guidelines

**Welcome, collaborators! Please follow the rules to ensure smooth development and integration.**

---

## 🏗 Folder Rules

- Create all your UI work inside your **team folder**:

## 📘 Commit Guidelines

- Use meaningful prefixes:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `refactor:` for code cleanup
- `docs:` for README or documentation

**Examples**:
feat: add loan application form
fix: corrected API endpoint for loan delete


---

## 🔄 Branching Guidelines

- Work on your **feature branch**, not `main`.
- Branch names: `team4-loan-form`, `team2-account-fix`

---

## 📦 Do Not Commit

- `node_modules`
- `.env`
- `.vscode/settings.json` (IDE-specific)

---

## 🚨 Code Quality

- Use Bootstrap components properly
- Keep components DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Use Axios from `services/` folder, not directly inside components

---

## 💡 Tips

- Push frequently and pull latest from `main` before merging
